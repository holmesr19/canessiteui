# Hockey Analytics Dashboards 

This began as a project to write a simple page that used as service to get data from an API and display it, just so I could get my feet wet with 
the Angular framework and CLI, Typescript, and Angular services. As I got more comfortable with both the tech I was using and the NHL API that 
I get my data from, I decided to start expanding and letting my features creep a little. I've tried to add desired, easy to use festures that let
the seasoned analyst and the casual hockey fan find enjoyable parts of the site. I know there's a lot of work to be done, but I'm trying to deliver 
functionality as fast as possible while I learn this technology.
